"Implementing a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for image classification involves preprocessing the Kaggle dataset of cats and dogs".Feature extraction techniques are applied to convert the images of cats and dogs into numerical feature vectos,Once trained and validated, the SVM model can be deployed to classify new images of cats and dogs with high accuracy.
